        into clear, useful insights. Currently, I am building a strong foundation in finance,
        accounting, and data analytics while exploring tools and technologies that help improve 
        decision-making. I am highly motivated, detail-oriented, and always eager to learn new 
        skills that help me grow both professionally and personally.
